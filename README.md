# MasterThesisClothingManipulationCode
The code relevant for the master thesis: "A Generative Adversarial Network approach using Latent Space Manipulation for Clothing Display on Synthetic Images"

Unfortunately, no real effort has been made to make this code presentable. The relevant images, datasets and files for most of these scripts were too large to upload to Github.
