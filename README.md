The code relevant for the master thesis: "A Generative Adversarial Network approach using Latent Space Manipulation for Clothing Display on Synthetic Images"

Unfortunately, no real effort has been made to make this code presentable. The relevant images, datasets and files for most of these scripts were too large to upload to Github.

Some of the most relevant were too large for Github, they may be found in the following Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JOwz21pargbTytMWVoKPjy37S58vRb6S?usp=sharing
